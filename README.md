# Chi-square-Test

Chi-square Test of the Difference between Observed and Expected Frequencies.

The SAS program for the example of white, brown and pied rabbits is as follows. Recall that the expected proportions of white, brown and pied rabbits are 0.36, 0.48 and 0.16, respectively. In a sample of 400 rabbits, there were 140 white, 240 brown and 20 pied. Are the proportions in that sample of rabbits different than expected?

#Output explanation

The first table presents categories (Color), the number and percentage of observations in each category (Frequency and Percent), the expected percentage (Test Percent), and the cumulative frequencies and percentages. In the second table the chi-square value (Chi-square), degrees of freedom (DF) and P-value (Pr > ChiSq) are presented. The highly significant Chi-Square (P < 0.0001) indicates that color percentages differ from those expected.
